* foreign-regexp.el --- search and replace by foreign regexp.

** CAUTION

THIS LIBRARY IS VERY EXPERIMENTAL, SO YOU MAY HAVE MANY
PROBLEM WITH THIS LIBRARY. AND THIS LIBRARY COMES WITH
NO WARRANTY.


** OVERVIEW

This library provides a feature, processing regular
expressions in manner of other programming languages
(we call it `foreign regexp' for convenience here),
to Emacs.

In particular, this library provides features corresponds to
such as `isearch-forward-regexp', `query-replace-regexp' and
`occur'.

Currently, regular expressions of Perl, Ruby, JavaScript and
Python can be used as foreign regexp.


** THE GUTS OF THIS LIBRARY

This library works like below:

1. Make a search/replace operation with foreign regexp
   through the user-interface of Emacs.

2. A search/replace operation will be executed by external
   commands (they are implemented in Perl, Ruby, JavaScript
   or Python).

3. Apply the result of search/replace operations to the buffer
   through the user-interface of Emacs.
   

** REQUIREMENTS

You need to have an Emacs which running on UNIX-like operating
system (*BSD/Linux/MacOSX) or Windows+Cygwin.

perl (>= 5.8), ruby (>= 1.9) node (Node.js, for JavaScript) or
python (only tested on 2.x), choose one of them as your taste,
is required as external command.

Also features `cl', `menu-bar' and `re-builder' are required.

For better multilingual support, Emacs (>= 21) may be required.

- NOTE (for Windows users) ::
  In some cases, virus scanner program makes each `foreign-regexp'
  command running extremely slow.
  On such case, turn off virus scanner program, or exclude the
  path which is specified by a variable `foreign-regexp/tmp-dir'
  from virus scanning.
  This may improve the response of each `foreign-regexp' command.


** INSTALLING
To install this library, save the file "foreign-regexp.el" to a directory
in your =load-path= (you can view the current =load-path= using
=C-h v load-path <RET>= within Emacs), then add following
lines to your =.emacs=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (require 'foreign-regexp)

  (custom-set-variables
  '(foreign-regexp/regexp-type 'perl) ;; Choose your taste of foreign regexp
                                      ;; from 'perl, 'ruby or 'javascript.
  '(reb-re-syntax 'foreign-regexp))   ;; Tell re-builder to use foreign regexp.
#+END_EXAMPLE


** USAGE EXAMPLES

In these examples, we suppose the contents of curent buffer are:

: 123---789

*** [Example-1] Query Replace in manner of Perl.

**** STEP-1: Set `foreign-regexp/regexp-type' to Perl.

: M-x foreign-regexp/regexp-type/set <RET> perl <RET>

- NOTE ::
  Once you choose REGEXP-TYPE, Emacs will remember it
  until exit. You can also set and save REGEXP-TYPE for
  next Emacs session by setting value via customize.
  See "COMMANDS (1) SETTING REGEXP-TYPE" section in this document.

**** STEP-2: Run query replace

: M-s M-% (\d+)---(\d+) <RET> ${1}456${2} <RET>

This command replaces the text in buffer:

: 123---789

with text:

: 123456789

- NOTE ::
Variables in replacement string are interpolated by Perl.


*** [Example-2] Query Replace in manner of Ruby.

**** STEP-1: Set regexp-type to Ruby.

: M-x foreign-regexp/regexp-type/set <RET> ruby <RET>

**** STEP-2: Run query replace 

: M-s M-% (\d+)---(\d+) <RET> #{$1}456#{$2} <RET>

This command replaces text in buffer:

: 123---789

with text:

: 123456789

Variables in replacement string are interpolated by ruby
as if they are in the replacement string inside of the
=String#gsub= method.


*** [Example-3] Query Replace in manner of JavaScript.

**** STEP-1: Set regexp-type to JavaScript.

: M-x foreign-regexp/regexp-type/set <RET> javascript <RET>

**** STEP-2: Run query replace 

: M-s M-% (\d+)---(\d+) <RET> $1456$2 <RET>

This command replaces text in buffer:

: 123---789

with text:

: 123456789

Variables in replacement string are interpolated
as if they are in =String.prototype.replace= method.

*** [Example-4] Query Replace in manner of Python.

**** STEP-1: Set regexp-type to Python.

: M-x foreign-regexp/regexp-type/set <RET> python <RET>

**** STEP-2: Run query replace

: M-s M-% (\d+)---(\d+) <RET> \g<1>456\g<2> <RET>

This command replaces text in buffer:

: 123---789

with text:

: 123456789

Backreferences in replacement string are interpolated
as if they are in `re.sub' method.


** COMMANDS

*** (1) SETTING REGEXP-TYPE

: M-x foreign-regexp/regexp-type/set <RET> REGEXP-TYPE <RET>

Set type of regexp syntax to REGEXP-TYPE.
By default, three regexp-types `perl', `ruby' and
`javascript' are provided.

You can also set REGEXP-TYPE via customization interface:

: M-x customize-apropos <RET> foreign-regexp/regexp-type <RET>


*** (2) SEARCH AND REPLACEMENT

- NOTE ::
  While editing a regular expression on the minibuffer prompt
  of `foreign-regexp' commands below, you can switch to another
  `foreign-regexp' command without losing current editing state.

: M-s M-o REGEXP <RET>
: M-x foreign-regexp/occur <RET> REGEXP <RET>

Show all lines in the current buffer containing a match
for foreign REGEXP.

: M-s M-% REGEXP <RET> REPLACEMENT <RET>
: M-x foreign-regexp/query-replace <RET> REGEXP <RET> REPLACEMENT <RET>

Replace some matches for foreign REGEXP with REPLACEMENT.
Note that notation of REPLACEMENT is different for
each REGEXP-TYPE.

: M-s M-s
: M-x foreign-regexp/isearch-forward <RET>

Begin incremental search for a foreign regexp.

: M-s M-r
: M-x foreign-regexp/isearch-backward <RET> REGEXP

Begin reverse incremental search for a foreign regexp.

: M-s M-f REGEXP <RET>
: M-x foreign-regexp/non-incremental/search-forward <RET> REGEXP <RET>

Search for a foreign REGEXP.

: M-s M-F REGEXP <RET>
: M-x foreign-regexp/non-incremental/search-backward <RET> REGEXP <RET>

Search for a foreign REGEXP backward.

: M-s M-g
: M-x nonincremental-repeat-search-forward

Search forward for the previous search string or regexp.

: M-s M-G
: M-x nonincremental-repeat-search-backward

Search backward for the previous search string or regexp.


*** (3) WORKING WITH SEARCH OPTIONS

- NOTE ::
  The status of each search option will be displayed by an
  indicator which is put on the minibuffer prompt of each
  `foreign-regexp' command, or put on the mode-line of a
  buffer `*RE-Builder*'. The indicator will be displayed
  like these: `[isxe]' for Perl, `[imxe]' for Ruby and
  `[ie]' for JavaScript.
       
: M-s M-i
: M-x foreign-regexp/toggle-case-fold <RET>

Toggle search option `case-fold-search'.

: M-s M-m
: M-x foreign-regexp/toggle-dot-match <RET>

Toggle search option `foreign-regexp/dot-match-a-newline-p'.

: M-s M-x
: M-x foreign-regexp/toggle-ext-regexp <RET>

Toggle search option `foreign-regexp/use-extended-regexp-p'.

: M-s M-e
: M-x foreign-regexp/toggle-eval-replacement <RET>

Toggle search option `foreign-regexp/eval-replacement-p'.

When this search option is on, the replacement string for
a command `foreign-regexp/query-replace' will be evaluated
as expression. For example, these commands:
  
- For `Perl': =M-s M-% ^ <RET> no strict 'vars';sprintf('%05d: ', ++$LINE) <RET>=
  - NOTE ::
    Replacement will be evaluated like REPLACEMENT in replacement operator
    with =e= option (like: =s/pattern/REPLACEMENT/e= ).
    In the replacement string, you can refer to special variables =$&=, =$1=, =&2=, ...
    and so on.
    
- For `Ruby': ~M-s M-% ^ <RET> { $LINE||=0;sprintf('%05d: ', $LINE+=1) } <RET>~
  - NOTE ::
    Replacement will be evaluated like a block passed to =String#gsub= method.
    In the block form, the current match string is passed in as a parameter,
    and you can refer to built-in variables =$&=, =$1=, =&2=, ... and so on.
    
- For `JavaScript': ~M-s M-% ^ <RET> function (m) {if(typeof(i)=='undefined'){i=0};return ('0000'+(++i)).substr(-5)+': '} <RET>~
  - NOTE ::
    Replacement will be evaluated like a function in the 2nd argument of the
    method =String.prototype.replace=.
    In the function, the current match string, captured strings (1 .. nth, if exits),
    the position where the match occurred, and the strings to be searched is passed
    as a argument, and you can refer to properties =RegExp.lastMatch=, =RegExp.$1=,
    ... and so on.

- For `Python': ~M-s M-% ^ <RET> i = 0 C-q C-j def f (m): C-q C-j <SPC> global i C-q C-j <SPC> i=i+1 C-q C-j <SPC> return '%05d: ' % i <RET>~
  - NOTE ::
    You can specify a function which takes match object as argument and returns
    replacement string, by =lambda= expression or =def= statement.
    And you can refer match and sub groups through match object,
    for example: =lambda m: m.group(0)=.
    
    When you specify a function by =def= statement, you can use arbitrary
    function name and you can put statements around the function.
    In this case, the first =def= statement will be called for each matches,
    and the other statements will be called only once before search/replacement
    operation has began.
    
    The first implementation of this library accepts only =lambda= expression
    as the replacement.
    Because of inconvenience of =lambda= expression, that it does not accept
    any statement like assignment operation, so we make this library to accept
    =def= statement.
    Additionally, we can't assign to uninitialized global variable in function
    defined by =def= statement, so we make it to accept statements around the
    =def= statement which can initialize global variables, for our convenience.

put line number to beginning of each lines.
 

*** (4): CONSTRUCTING REGEXP WITH RE-BUILDER

: M-x reb-change-syntax <RET> foreign-regexp <RET>

Set the syntax used by the `re-builder' to foreign regexp.

: M-s M-l
: M-x re-builder <RET>

  call commands below in `*RE-Builder*' buffer:

: M-s M-o
: M-x foreign-regexp/re-builder/occur-on-target-buffer

Run `foreign-regexp/occur' in `reb-target-buffer'
with a foreign regexp in the buffer `*RE-Builder*'.

Run `foreign-regexp/non-incremental/search-forward' in `reb-target-buffer'
with a foreign regexp in the buffer `*RE-Builder*'.

: M-s M-F
: M-x foreign-regexp/re-builder/non-incremental-search-backward-on-target-buffer

Run `foreign-regexp/non-incremental/search-backward' in `reb-target-buffer'
with a foreign regexp in the buffer `*RE-Builder*'.


- NOTE-2 ::
  You can switch search options of the
  `reb-target-buffer' with commands below:

: M-s M-i
: M-x foreign-regexp/re-builder/toggle-case-fold-on-target-buffer

Toggle search option `case-fold-search' of `reb-target-buffer'.

: M-s M-m
: M-x foreign-regexp/re-builder/toggle-dot-match-on-target-buffer

Toggle search option `foreign-regexp/dot-match-a-newline-p'
of `reb-target-buffer'.

: M-s M-x
: M-x foreign-regexp/re-builder/toggle-ext-regexp-on-target-buffer

Toggle search option `foreign-regexp/use-extended-regexp-p'
of `reb-target-buffer'.

: M-\
: M-x foreign-regexp/quote-meta-in-region <RET>

Escape characters in region, that would have special meaning
in foreign regexp.


*** (5) ALIGNMENT USING FOREIGN REGEXP

: C-M-|
: M-x align

Align region according to pre-defined alignment rules.

Foreign regexp can be used in a rule by putting an
`regexp-type' attribute on the alignment rule.

Example)
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (add-to-list
   'align-rules-list
   '(perl-and-ruby-hash-form
    
     ;; This rule will be applied when `regexp-type'
     ;; is `perl' or `ruby'.
     (regexp-type . '(perl ruby))
    
     (regexp . "([ \\t]*)=>[ \\t]*[^# \\t\\n]") ;; Foreign Regexp
     (group  . 1)
     (repeat . t)
     (modes  . '(perl-mode cperl-mode ruby-mode))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

See also `align-rules-list' and help document of an advice
of `align-region' for more information about alignment rules.

: M-s M-a REGEXP <RET>
: M-x foreign-regexp/align <RET> REGEXP <RET>

Align the current region using a partial foreign regexp
read from the minibuffer.

The foreign regexp read from the minibuffer will be
supposed to be placed after whitespaces.

See also `align-regexp'.

: C-u M-s M-a REGEXP <RET> GROUP <RET> SPACING <RET> REPEAT <RET>
: C-u M-x foreign-regexp/align <RET> REGEXP <RET> GROUP <RET> SPACING <RET> REPEAT <RET>

Align the current region using an ad-hoc rule read from the minibuffer.

Example)
  < Use perl-style foreign regexp in this example. >

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  When texts in region is:
  
       (one 1)
       (ten 10)
       (hundred 100)
       (thousand 1000)
  
  Run command on the region with options:
  
       REGEXP: ([ \t]+)\d
                    |
                    +--- GROUP: 1
                         Alignment will be applied to each
                         lines by inserting white-spaces to
                         the place where the capture group
                         specified by `GROUP' is matched to.
       SPACING: 1
       REPEAT:  y
  
  Result is:
  
       (one      1)
       (ten      10)
       (hundred  100)
       (thousand 1000)
                |
                +---- Aligned using SPACING spaces.
#+END_EXAMPLE

** FOR HACKERS
You might use regexp syntax of your choice of language, by
making four external commands below with the language:
 
`foreign-regexp/replace/external-command'
`foreign-regexp/occur/external-command'
`foreign-regexp/search/external-command'
`foreign-regexp/quote-meta/external-command'

and install these commands with the function
`foreign-regexp/regexp-type/define'.

See help documents of these variables and functions
for more information.


** KNOWN PROBLEMS
 - Codes aside, this document should be rewritten.
   My English sucks :-(

** WISH LIST
 - History for `re-builder'.
 - `grep' with foreign regexp?
 - `tags-search', `tags-query-replace', `dried-do-search' and
   `dired-do-query-replace-regexp' with foreign regexp?
 - `multi-isearch-buffers-regexp', `multi-occur',
   `multi-occur-in-matching-buffers', `how-many', `flush-lines',
   and `keep-lines' with foreign regexp?
 - Better error messages.
 - Write Tests.
